# Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook is an attempt to learn times series data hands on manner. The dataset comes from the Kaggle Competition XYZ, and the approach to the solution is heavily inspired by the tutorials and lectures of Time Series Data, present of  as well. I tried to put my own spin on it though :D

Just run the whole notebook and sit back if you want to obtain insight and enjoy the many visuals and plots.
